	\paragraph{Hypothesis}
	~\\
	B cells from Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy (THI) patients exhibit more DNA methylation, indicating incomplete B cell differentiation, than individuals without THI.
	
	\section{Background}
	
		Immunoglobulins are a vital component of the adaptive immune system \citep{Simon15}.  
		The B cells which produce antibodies (active immunoglobulin) in adults are not fully mature in young infants, hence serum immunoglobulin levels decrease after birth \citep{Martin10,Rechavi15,Stiemh80}. 
		Physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia refers to the point when serum immunoglobulin reaches its lowest level, commonly at 4 to 6 months of age \citep{Dressler89}. 
		THI is a disorder where regular hypogammaglobulinemia is prolonged or exacerbated then spontaneously alleviated. \citep{Stiemh80,Dressler89,AlHerz14,Gitlin56,AlHerz11,Rosen66,McGeady87, Dalal98,Tiller78,Buckley83}.
		The mechanism causing low serum immunoglobulin in THI patients is unknown \citep{AlHerz14}. 

	
		\paragraph{Cause of THI} 
			~\\
			Immunoglobulin deficiency can result from B cell precursors failing to develop into mature B cells or mature B cells failing to differentiate into antibody secreting plasma cells \citep{Fiorilli86}. 
			Studies investigating THI have found that levels of circulating B cells are normal and subpopulations of B cells are intact \citep{Tiller78,Stiemh80,Siegel81,Buckley83,Fiorilli86,Dressler89}.
			With no obvious B cell deficiency, the cause of THI has been speculated extensively, but no proposed cause has been supported by replicated evidence \citep{Fudenberg64,Rosen66,Nathenson71,Willenbockel60,Soothill68,Tiller78,Fiorilli86,Ovadia14,Siegel81,McGeady87}.
			
			In regards to genetic inheritance, THI was initially thought to be familial \citep{Willenbockel60}. 
			\citet{Soothill68} proposed that THI was a manifestation of genetic heterozygosity for other immunodeficiency diseases, noting the high number of patients who had immunodeficient relatives.
			While it remains a possibility, no proceeding studies have shown supporting evidence \citep{Tiller78,Fiorilli86, Ovadia14}.
			
			
	\section{Lineage commitment}

		Activation and differentiation of T cells is governed greatly by epigenetic changes which affirm the lineage \citep{Zeng13}.
		DNA methylation was both the first epigenetic mechanism recognised, and the one most extensively studied \citep{Begin14}. 
		In T regulatory cells (Treg), the methylation status of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) is imperative in Treg differentiation \citep{Polansky08}.
		Tregs are induced by T cell receptor engagement which causes demethylation at the TSDR.
		FOXP3, the Treg inducing protein, can then bind to its own gene stabilising its expression and hence stabilising differentiation to Treg lineage.
		FOXP3 is also expressed during the activation of other T cell subsets, but due to the methylation of the TSDR, FOXP3 expression is transient \citep{Ohkura13}.
		Therefore, demethylation permits FOXP3 binding and thence confirms Treg lineage.
		
	\section{Proposal}
	
		The most intriguing feature of THI is its self-limited nature: recurrent infections gradually subside and serum IgG levels increase with no obvious cause  \citep{Tiller78,Soothill68,Siegel81,McGeady87,Dressler89,Kowalczyk97,Dalal98}. 
		Furthermore, the lack of evidence supporting a genetic basis suggests that the cause of THI is not within the genome \citep{Tiller78,Fiorilli86,Ovadia14}.
		
		\newpage
		
		In common variable immunodeficiency, a disease related to THI, some B cells resemble immature B cells producing very little IgG \citep{Fiorilli86}. 
		Incomplete maturation results in limited IgG production, so it is possible that the delayed onset of IgG synthesis in THI is also due to incomplete B cell maturation.
		Development and differentiation are greatly influenced by epigenetic changes; latent maturity could be caused by inappropriate methylation of B cell development or differentiation genes. 

		To study incomplete lineage commitment B cells will be sampled from THI patients and age-matched controls then characterised using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.
		As in \citet{Kulis15} DNA methylation maps will be generated for sorted human B cell populations: uncommitted haematopoietic progenitor cells, pre-BII cells, plasma cells from bone marrow, germinal center B cells, \naive B cells from peripheral blood and memory B cells from peripheral blood.
		Global demethylation normally occurs as B cells mature \citep{Oakes16}. 
		If methylation is a cause of delayed maturation, the methylome of THI patients should be distinct to the age-matched controls.
